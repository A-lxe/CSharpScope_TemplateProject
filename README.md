# CSharpScope Template Project  

## Overview
[unity, c#, js, json]

CsharpScope are a set of tools allowing HCI interfaces to be developed for urban design, architecture, spatial analysis, transportation planning and more.  These tools aim to allow Unity based development of interaction with tangible models, using projection mapping, cloud-based data, color-tagged object detection and more.


This empty-shell project contains 3 main components for running a basic CityScope table which include:
1. Scanning module [GridDecoder]
2. Data viz of scanned table [CityIO_Unity]
3. Projection mapping [PrjMap]

These modules are later to be extended using urban context model, data and vizualizations
